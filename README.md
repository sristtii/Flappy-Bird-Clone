# Flappy-Bird-Clone

So,In this repo you will find the clone for the flappy bird game which was quite famous and an nostalgic game.
Starting out as a beginner, I decided to make a Flappy Bird game in Unity. I worked hard to copy the original game exactly. It was tough, but I didn't give up. Step by step, I saw my game coming together. It felt amazing to see something I made myself, showing that anyone can learn and create cool stuff.
